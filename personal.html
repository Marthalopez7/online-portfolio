            <h4>The Pursuit of Healthyness Infographic</h4>
           <p>The Pursuit of Healthyness project was detailed to create a company that would teach individuals about common misconceptions about healthcare. In the poster it detailed our slogan, social media, mission statement, and goals. As a group we presented this to others so that they could learn more about healthcare misconceptions or myths. When presenting, we asked the audience to play a game of telephone to show how myths can occur. When participants finished the game of telephone, the original sentence had changed in some way. To create our poster, we used the software called <i>Canva</i> . To conduct research about different health myths, we used the internet and different credible websites. In addition, while I did contribute to the telephone activity and the presentation, I mainly worked on the project video. </p>

            <h4>The Pursuit of Healthyness Video</h4>
           <p>The Pursuit of Healthyness video was a visual guide walking the audience through the different healthcare misconceptions mentioned in our presentation. The video was inspired by Charlie Chaplin and was filmed in a black and white, silent film style. To create this film, I used Photoshop for the title cards, <i>Adobe After Effects</i>  to edit the video, Adobe Fonts for the font, and Google for the title card template.    </p>
