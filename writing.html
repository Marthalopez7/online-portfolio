              <h4>DelveHomes Reflective Essay</h4>
              <p>My first written example is titled Career Research Essay. This essay was part of a longer assignment where we first conducted research. After researching different careers in tech, we were tasked with choosing one and conducting further research, specific to that job. In my case, I chose software development. In this essay, I described what software developers do, how they work, and who they work with. This essay also included how to build and start a career in software development. I selected this work to share because I believe it highlights my ability to research a topic and write an essay based on that research.</p>

              <div class="writing-box-one"></div>
              <div class="writing-box-two"></div>
              <h4>Career Research Essay</h4>
              <p>The second writing example is another essay titled Delve Homes Reflective Essay. This was an explanatory type of essay based on a web development project we had done in the past. In this essay, I described the details of the Delve Homes project and website. This means that I wrote an essay going into depth about the steps my partner and I took to complete the website and our challenges and successes. I chose this essay to share because I think it shows how I can write a reflective essay that is easy to understand and describes the project well.</p>
