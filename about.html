Originally, the hotel was very big and popular with a lot of people visiting and staying at the hotel. However, after the death of one of the guests mysteriously passes away and the hotel’s concierge Gustave H. receives a very expensive painting from her will and her family believes that he murdered her. In this murder-mystery type film, followed by Wes Anderson's amazing cinematics, viewers are entranced by the story. This is one of my favorite films and I will always recommend it to others.</p></div>

Set in the eighteenth century on an island in Brittany, a young female painter is tasked with creating a wedding portrait of another young lady. However, she must do so without the young lady taking notice. Céline Sciamma really shows her skills as a director by showing the world through a woman's perspective using her personal experiences and insights as a woman. This film encaptures every emotion and really captivates the audience. In the future, I hope to share my perspective through my own work as well and hopefully have as great of an impact as the amazing Céline Sciamma.</p></div>

Gia starts off working at a diner when she meets a photographer and participates in a photoshoot. Shortly after, she learns that people think that she can be a star when she travels to New York City. Shortly after arriving, modal agent Wilhelmina Cooper immediately takes her in, seeing Gia’s potential. The film walks us through Gia’s experiences and does not leave out any hardships and pain. Which makes this film feel so human and real.</p></div>
