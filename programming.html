            <a href="https://sustainable-consumption.netlify.app/"><h4>A Wish From the Earth</h4></a>
            <p>A Wish from the Earth, is one of my favorite projects that I have had the chance to work on this year. The requirements for this project were to inform the public about a specific social issue and ways that, as an individual, can help. Sustainability and sustainable consumption are the topics that I researched for this project and included on the final website. Although we had creative liberty as to what our website could look like, we were not allowed to actually code our website. To practice management skills, my peers coded my website while I would advise them on how to code it and vice versa. This led to some insights like reading and working with other people’s code. As well as learning to convey your vision of the website to others. Despite the fact that this was my favorite project, there were still some elements that I could improve and would change if I had the chance. For example, I would add animations now that I have learned to use JavaScript. To learn more about JavaScript and my experience with it, head over to the project titled BattleWitch.</p>  

            <h3 id="p2">Project Two</h3>
              <div class="programming-box-three"><img src="images/battlewitch-icon.jpg" alt="battlewitch-icon"></div>
              <!-- <div class="programming-box-four"></div> -->
              <a href="https://battlewitch-2023.netlify.app/"><h4>BattleWitch</h4></a>
              <p>BattleWitch was created based on the board game Battleship. In this project, we were to digitize a board game and make it our own by adding a twist while working with a partner. In our case, we changed some aspects of the original game like having witch characters instead of battleships. The twist we added was that the witch characters could touch. We also created more of a challenge by including less characters and making turns shorter. This was one of the first projects we created after learning JavaScript. I definitely learned a lot from this project, specifically more about JavaScript in general. But since this was a project that functioned on Javascript, it came with a lot of issues. Since I am still a beginner to JavaScript, I had to do a lot of research and investigation before and during the project to troubleshoot and plan. In addition, I would take some time to reflect to find the solution to the problem in a different way. Nevertheless, building this project was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it a lot.

            <h3 id="p3">Project Three</h3>
              <div class="programming-box-five"><img src="images/delvehomes-icon.jpg" alt="delvehomes-icon"></div>
              <!-- <div class="programming-box-six"></div> -->
              <a href="https://delvehomes2022.netlify.app/"><h4>DelveHomes</h4></a>
              <p>DelveHomes was the first website I created and although it is not my best work I am proud of it. This is because I learned a lot while making it and it really solidified my decision to work in tech because of how much fun I had while making it. The requirements of this project was to create a website selling rooms to the public based on the novel The Machine Stops by E.M Forster. Since this was my first time building a website with a partner, I learned how to collaborate with them through trial and error. For example, we figured out that we both couldn’t work on the same page as it would cause problems troubleshooting later on. I also learned how to effectively communicate because of this. I often look back and see how much more I have learned and elements I could have improved upon. For example, I would add more textures similar to the project: A Wish from the Earth.  In addition, I also learned how to work with a partner for the first time as well as the basics of GitHub, Netlify, and Visual Studio Code. Overall, this project is a great reference point to show my growth in web development as well as my passion for working in this field.</p>  

            <h3 id="p4">Project Four</h3>
              <div class="programming-box-seven"><img src="images/layout-icon.jpg" alt="layout-icon"></div>
              <!-- <div class="programming-box-eight"></div> -->
              <a href="https://layout-practice-2022.netlify.app/"><h4>Layout Practice</h4></a>
              <p>This project is referred to as layout practice. This is because this assignment required that students copy a layout provided by the teacher and replicate it. This assignment developed my skills in replicating work as well as coding it in your own way but still ended up with a result that is similar to the original. This project required that you take some time to reflect as well as persist. Sometimes, even if you thought you could not replicate an element, you would have to persist to learn how to replicate it.  I learned how to use new tools and selectors as a result. For example, I learned how to create a textbox for people to leave messages at. The elements I used in this project were then used on future projects. This improved the quality of my work.</p>
